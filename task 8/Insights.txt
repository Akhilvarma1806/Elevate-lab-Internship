Sales Seasonality: The business demonstrates strong seasonality, with a clear peak in sales during 
                   the final quarter of the year (October through December).
                   Management should focus inventory and marketing spend during this period to maximize revenue.

Regional Leadership: The West Region consistently leads in total sales revenue, contributing the highest percentage
                     compared to the other regions. Resources could be allocated to understand and replicate successful 
                     strategies from the West in underperforming regions.

Profitability vs. Revenue: While Office Supplies typically drives the highest volume of transactions, 
                           the Technology category generates the highest average Profit Margin. 
                           This suggests a strategic focus on promoting high-value technology items could quickly
                           boost overall profitability.

Cost Warning (Furniture): Despite contributing significantly to overall revenue, the Furniture category often shows 
                          the lowest profit margin (or the highest losses) due to high discounts and shipping costs.
                          A review of pricing or logistics for Furniture is necessary to improve profitability.
